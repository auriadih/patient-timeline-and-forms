## Installation

### Database

The program was developed with PostgreSQL 10, so that or higher should work. After installing PostgreSQL on your server, create the database and fill it with test data using scripts in the db directory.


# Repository still missing some bits

Full code base for the installable software will be available by the end of 2020.
